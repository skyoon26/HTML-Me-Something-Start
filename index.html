               <p>Hello, World! &#10024 I'm from the St. Louis area, and I'm an aspiring full-stack web developer.</p>

               <h2>About Me</h2>
               <p id="testP">I used to be a registered nurse. Healthcare was all I knew, and I never really questioned it. A turn of events during the pandemic put my nursing career on pause, and I found myself working over 50 hours a week at my parents' dry cleaners. Little did I know it would be in this unexpected and challenging season where I would venture into the world of web development.</p>

               <h2>Fast Forward</h2>
               <p class="funParagraph">I'm learning to code, and I feel lucky to say I love it. I'm currently enrolled as a student at LaunchCode where I'm learning JavaScript and will be covering additional languages and frameworks such as ReactJS, Java, and Spring Boot. I hope to become a mindful, creative, and dependable developer that can bring the same level of human connection and care into my work as I have before.</p>
